1. Goal
Clone a repository and find a password

2. Commands
git

3. Solution

Like in previous levels, I created my own directory and cloned a repository there:

mkdir /tmp/user
cd /user
git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo

There is a single README.md file, so cat:

cat README.md 
# Bandit Notes
Some notes for bandit30 of bandit.

## credentials

- username: bandit30
- password: <no passwords in production!>

It means simply that there are other branches and we are already in production one, so:

git branch -a
* (HEAD detached at origin/master)
  master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/dev
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/sploits-dev

Gives me a list of branches, let's jump to origin/dev

git checkout origin/dev

I type git show = to see the difference between commits and I get

    add data needed for development
