1. Goal:

The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

TL:DR = We need to find password stored in file compressed many times

2. Commands:
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file

3. Solution

- I create folder in /tmp , so cd /tmp and mkdir blabla
- I type cat data.txt to see what is inside main file:

[200~00000000: 1f8b 0808 d7d2 c55b 0203 6461 7461 322e  .......[..data2.
00000010: 6269 6e00 013c 02c3 fd42 5a68 3931 4159  bin..<...BZh91AY
00000020: 2653 591d aae5 9800 001b ffff de7f 7fff  &SY.............
00000030: bfb7 dfcf 9fff febf f5ad efbf bbdf 7fdb  ................
00000040: f2fd ffdf effa 7fff fbd7 bdff b001 398c  ........

We get hexdumped file.

- from list of commands I took xxd and in man xxd we see:

NAME
       xxd - make a hexdump or do the reverse.

So I need to do reverse, then:

  -r | -revert
              reverse operation: convert (or patch) hexdump into  binary.   If
              not  writing  to stdout, xxd writes into its output file without
              truncating it. Use the combination -r -p to read plain hexadeci‐
              mal dumps without line number information and without a particu‐
              lar column layout. Additional  Whitespace  and  line-breaks  are
              allowed anywhere.

- xxd -r data.txt > reverted

I get reverted file knowing that it was compressed, but how to find out with what method? I use command file

- file reverted = gives:

reverted: gzip compressed data, was "data2.bin", last modified: Tue Oct 16 12:00:23 2018, max compression, from Unix

So we know we need to use gzip to decompress it again, but before we change reverted to reverted.gz 

- mv reverted reverted.gz

and then knowing from man gzip:

 -d --decompress --uncompress
              Decompress.

- gzip -d reverted.gz = gives once again file named reverted
- file reverted:
reverted: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k

This time we need to use bzip2:

- bzip2 -d reverted
bzip2: Can't guess original name for reverted -- using reverted.out

- file reverted.out

Gives us once again:

reverted.out: gzip compressed data, was "data4.bin", last modified: Tue Oct 16 12:00:23 2018, max compression, from Unix

Basically, we use gzip, bzip2 and tar to decompress and verify with command filewhat filetype we get from previous operations. After mutiple decompressions, finally I get:

cat data8
The password is 8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL

It was exhausting :)
