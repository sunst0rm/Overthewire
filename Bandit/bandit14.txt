1. Goal:

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

2. Commands:

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

3. Solution

We check password from current level and copy it:

bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e

Then we pass it using telnet:

bandit14@bandit:~$ telnet localhost 30000
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
