1. Goal:
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, beginning with several ‘=’ characters.

2. Commands:
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

3. Solution

Password needs to be:
- human readable string
- beginning with '=' characters
- one from many strings

I type:
- cat data.txt = this lets me view a file, I see some non-string characters. First idea is to use base64 and decode this file:

       base64 - base64 encode/decode data and print to standard output

- base64 -d data.txt = gives me error base64: invalid input = it is wrong then

- base64 data.txt = changes characters into strings, good.

I try to pipe base64 data.txt | strings but without flags it does not give anything, until the moment I find:

       -e encoding
       --encoding=encoding
           Select the character encoding of the strings that are to be found.  Possible values for encoding are: s =
           single-7-bit-byte characters (ASCII, ISO 8859, etc., default), S = single-8-bit-byte characters, b =
           16-bit bigendian, l = 16-bit littleendian, B = 32-bit bigendian, L = 32-bit littleendian.  Useful for
           finding wide character strings. (l and b apply to, for example, Unicode UTF-16/UCS-2 encodings).

so I type

- strings -e s 

and bingo, I get password but among other different characters and I want one clean command

I read man tr and man uniq but nothing gives me the idea where to go.

I check man grep (as I need to pipe the result anyway) and find:

  -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
              Use PATTERN as the pattern.  If this option is used  multiple  times  or  is  combined  with  the  -f
              (--file)  option,  search  for  all  patterns  given.   This  option can be used to protect a pattern
              beginning with “-”.

The password has many "=" in the beginning, so

 strings -e s data.txt | grep -a "="

but we need several "=" so:

 strings -e s data.txt | grep -a "===="

gives

========== password

Got it!
