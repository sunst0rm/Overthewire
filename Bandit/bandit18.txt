1. Goal

The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

2. Commands
ssh, cat, ls

3. Solution

I know that password to bandit19 is in /home/bandit18/readme file but when I try access the server it logs me out automatically.

Firstly, I tried to contrive using -o (option) flag but was only getting errors.

After little googling, I found out it is possible to execute commands between '' marks typing them in the end. What about trying to cat readme file ?

ssh -p 2220 bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org 'exec cat /home/bandit18/readme'

After being asked and typed previously copied password I got

Bingo, it worked!
