1. Goal

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think

2. Commands
ssh, nc, cat, bash, screen, tmux, Unix ‘job control’ (bg, fg, jobs, &, CTRL-Z, …)

3. Solution

I open tmux - Ctrl+b - % to get two simultaneous windows of same session.

I set up netcat listening on random port 1234 and passing password of this level in first terminal:

bandit20@bandit:~$ echo "GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j" | nc -l -p  1234

then switch to second, so Ctrl+b - arrow right,  and type:

./suconnect 1234

So it returns:

Read: GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j
Password matches, sending next password

and in the same time netcat in first terminal stops and give me password to bandit21:
