1. Goal:
The password for next level is stored in file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once

2. Possible commands: 
grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd

We should also use piping.

3. Solution:
- cat data.txt = gives bunch of random characters
- cat data.txt | sorts = I thought it will input and sort stdout but no.
- sort data.txt = sorts the content and gives many groups of same lines of characters

We need to find the only line of text that occurs once, so let's see what man sort says - nothing I find useful.
I do not find anything in man strings either, however man uniq becomes interesting:

       uniq - report or omit repeated lines

One particular flag catches my eye:

       -u, --unique
              only print unique lines

Bingo!

4. Final

sort data.txt | uniq -u

- sort data.txt = sorts data.txt file
- | = redirects output - stdout of commands before
- uniq -u = prints unique line from data.txt
