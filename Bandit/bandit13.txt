1. Goal

The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

2. Commands

ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap

3. Solution

We have a private key and bandit14 is on the same machine as bandit14, so man ssh:

     -i identity_file
             Selects a file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.  The
             default is ~/.ssh/id_dsa, ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa, ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 and ~/.ssh/id_rsa.  Identity files
             may also be specified on a per-host basis in the configuration file.  It is possible to have
             multiple -i options (and multiple identities specified in configuration files).  If no certifi‐
             cates have been explicitly specified by the CertificateFile directive, ssh will also try to load
             certificate information from the filename obtained by appending -cert.pub to identity filenames.

Then I try

ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost
Could not create directory '/home/bandit13/.ssh'.
The authenticity of host 'localhost (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:98UL0ZWr85496EtCRkKlo20X3OPnyPSB5tB5RPbhczc.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
bandit14@bandit:~$ 

I am logged as bandit14.

Password for each level and accessible by user from that level is in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
