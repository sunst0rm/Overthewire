I create a temporary directory,  git clone, check README.md file, changes and branch:

bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SxuWGmS8el/repo$ cat README.md 
just an epmty file... muahaha
bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SxuWGmS8el/repo$ git show
commit 3aa4c239f729b07deb99a52f125893e162daac9e

    initial commit of README.md

There is nothing in logs either:

By googling I found out a function called "tag":

Tags are ref's that point to specific points in Git history. Tagging is generally used to capture a point in history that is used for a marked version release (i.e. v1.0.1). A tag is like a branch that doesn't change. Unlike branches, tags, after being created, have no further history of commits.

So TL:DR it is a branch that has no history, let's chech if some tags exist:

bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SxuWGmS8el/repo$ git tag
help
secret

Great!

bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.SxuWGmS8el/repo$ git show secret

Gives password to bandit31
