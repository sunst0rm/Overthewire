1. Goal

A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

2. Solution

I need to write a script that checks 10000 combination, of course before creating a /tmp/XXXX folder.

#!/bin/bash
bandit24=UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ

for pin in {9999..0000}; do
        echo "$bandit24 $pin"
done | nc localhost 30002

I get
